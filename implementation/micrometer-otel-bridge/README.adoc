= Micrometer to OpenTelemetry bridge

This is a PoC implementation of a CDI bridge between Micrometer and OpenTelemetry. It uses OpenTelemetry's Micrometer Instrumentation for Micrometer version 1.5 and higher.

The code is instrumented using the Micrometer API and the assertions are performed on the results provided by the OpenTelemetry exporter.

Provides support only for the `@Counted` annotation.
